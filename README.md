As usual, this project got stuck in the basics, namely coding of a well behaved GS/OS 5/6 application with Mac-like behaviour. Anyway, someone might have some use for the code :-)

I provide the code as is. I haven’t touched it for decades. Have fun!

**Files**

- ``*.asm`` source files for the projects. I don’t remember how it all adds up, but everything should be there
- ``gen, mak`` some workflow automation files
- ``CodeBurger.image.zip`` Zipped disk image file containg the ChemiGS program and some sample files.
